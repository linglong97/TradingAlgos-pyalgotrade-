# TradingAlgos-pyalgotrade-
A repository of me learning how to make algorithmic trading models, and backtesting using pyalgotrade. Pulled from google finance. In the future, using quantopian and testing with cryptocurrency are things I want to do. Additionally, i'd like to build models in C++ to learn more applicable methods.
